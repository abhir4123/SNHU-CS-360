The goal of my app was to help users manage and track inventory items. It was designed to let users add, update, and delete items, while also sending SMS alerts when stock ran low or hit zero. This app addressed the need for a simple tool that helps users stay organized and avoid running out of important items.

The app included a login/signup screen and an inventory screen with a grid layout to show items. I kept the UI clean and simple, using clear buttons and text fields that were easy to understand. I also added pop-up dialogs for updating items, which made the experience smoother. The design worked well because it was straightforward and focused on usability.

I broke the app into small parts and focused on one feature at a time. I used clear naming conventions, in-line comments, and tested features as I added them. This method kept things organized and helped avoid bugs. I can apply the same approach in future projects by continuing to code in small steps and test often.

I tested the app on an Android emulator to check compatibility and behavior. I made sure each button and feature worked correctly, especially login, inventory actions, and SMS alerts. Testing helped me find small issues early and made sure the app worked as intended, even when permissions were denied.

One challenge I faced was figuring out how to update individual inventory items through the user interface. At first, I only had options to add or delete items, but users needed a way to adjust quantities too. I solved this by creating a pop-up dialog that let users enter a new amount for any item. This solution improved the appâ€™s functionality while keeping the interface simple and user-friendly.

I was especially successful in implementing the SMS alert system. It only sent messages when inventory levels were low or empty and handled permission checks carefully. This feature tied together database logic, UI input, and system-level permissions, which showed my ability to build a complete and responsive feature from end to end.
